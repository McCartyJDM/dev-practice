                <p>Founded in 1833 by <a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Charles_Winthrop">Robert Charles Winthrop</a> shortly after completing his bar examination. He saw the need for food and lodging for delegates of the Massachusetts House of Representatives while they convened at the State House nearby in Beacon Hill. Staff at Hotel BT has entertained royalty, housed heads of State, and conducted prestigious events in our Great Hall. We take pride in providing the perfect Boston experience. Your stay at Hotel BT will be one for the memory books! </p>

                <p>I can't believe I was able to stay in such a historical place during my trip to Boston. We could see the State House right from our room! Unforgettable way to see the city. Our family will definitely be coming back to Hotel BT for our next trip to Boston. Would recommend for history buffs and bucket list addicts alike!</p>

                <p>What a wonderful place to start your tour of New England! The hotel is well managed and the staff and rooms are gorgeous! When you arrive you're greeted by concierge at the entrance and given a guide to the city, discount books for museums and day trips, and a menu for the complimentary hotel food!</p>
